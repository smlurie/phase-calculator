# Phase Calculator Plugin [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2548743.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2548743)

A plugin for the [Open Ephys GUI](https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI) to estimate the phase of inputs within a specified passband in real time. Its primary purpose is to enable closed-loop stimulation, typically in combination with the [Crossing Detector](https://github.com/tne-lab/crossing-detector) and either the Pulse Pal or an external stimulation system that receives ZeroMQ events (for example, the LabVIEW implementation [here](https://github.com/tne-lab/closed-loop-stim)). It can also output the magnitude or imaginary component of the band-limited analytic signal instead of the phase. (The "PH+MAG" mode outputs both phase and magnitude, in separate channels.) Finally, the visualization tab or window can receive TTL events and display the delayed but precise phase of a specified input at the event onset samples in a rose plot. This allows real-time monitoring of stimulation accuracy.

The following article describes the algorithm used by the previous version of this plugin and the closed-loop stimulation pipeline as a whole:

## Installation

(Instructions here are for Windows and Linux - Mac support may be coming soon.)

### Step 1: Decide which version to use.

* You are on the `hilbert-transformer` branch, which uses a [Hilbert transformer](https://www.intechopen.com/books/matlab-a-fundamental-tool-for-scientific-computing-and-engineering-applications-volume-1/digital-fir-hilbert-transformers-fundamentals-and-efficient-design-methods) FIR filter instead - actually one of several, depending on the frequency band you are filtering to. This is more efficient than the original (published) algorithm since it doesn't require as much AR model-based prediction nor calculating an FFT on each step. **There is an updated version on `master` - this branch is deprecated.**

* If you want, you can switch to the `old-version` branch, which uses the Fourier-transform-based [Hilbert transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_transform) over a sliding window to estimate the analytic signal (from which we derive the phase). We have been testing variants of this algorithm in our lab since mid-2016, and it is now fairly polished, but is somewhat less computationally efficient than the newer version.

* Alternatively, you can use the `tnel-development` branch of [tne-lab/plugin-GUI](https://github.com/tne-lab/plugin-GUI/tree/tnel-development), which is a fork of the Open Ephys GUI source code with this plugin and some other useful ones already built in. Then you don't even need this repository or the rest of the instructions! (If you're on Linux though, you'll still have to install FFTW as described below.) Beware though, these are development branches and will be more unstable than `open-ephys/plugin-GUI/master`.

### All platforms:

* If you haven't already, download the base source at https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI (either by cloning or downloading a ZIP file from the `master` branch).

  * If you already have the source or your own fork, it must be new enough to have the `DspLib` library, which was added on Feb 8, 2018 on the development branch (commit `2dcb98b...`).


* Download/clone this repository, making sure you're on the desired branch as described above.

* Create the directory `plugin-GUI/Source/Plugins/PhaseCalculator` and copy all contents of this repository's `Source` into it.

### Windows (Visual Studio 2013)

* Create the directory `plugin-GUI/Builds/VisualStudio2013/Plugins/PhaseCalculator`and copy all contents of `Builds/VisualStudio2013` into it.

* Copy the contents of `Resources/DLLs/VS2013` and `Resources/DLLs/VS2013-x64` into the corresponding directories in your `plugin-GUI` repository.

* Copy `Resources/windows-libs/FFTW` into `plugin-GUI/Resources/windows-libs`.

* Open `plugin-GUI/Builds/VisualStudio2013/open-ephys.sln` and build as normal for your target build configuration(s).

* Open `plugin-GUI/Builds/VisualStudio2013/Plugins/Plugins.sln`. Right-click on the solution in Solution Explorer, select `Add -> Existing Project...`, and open `plugin-GUI/Builds/VisualStudio2013/Plugins/PhaseCalculator/PhaseCalculator.vcxproj` to add it to the solution. Then build as normal.

### Linux

* You need to install FFTW 3 (if not already present) into the standard library/header locations. See [here](http://www.fftw.org/download.html) for instructions on building from source. Many distributions may also provide FFTW 3 available in their package repositories. For instance, Ubuntu/Debian/Linux Mint provide the package `libfftw3-dev` (available on Ubuntu 14.04 "trusty" and later). The package on Arch Linux appears to be called simply `fftw`.

* Once FFTW is installed, compile as usual with `make -f Makefile.plugins PhaseCalculator`.

## Usage

### Main functionality

* ***Important!*** Since the phase estimation algorithm is somewhat processor-intensive, by default all input channels are disabled. To enable the channels you would like to estimate the phase (or other component) of, select them in the "PARAM" section of the drawer. If "PH+MAG" is selcected as the output, this will also create the additional magnitude outputs for each selected input.

* In the "freq range" dropdown menu, choose a range of frequencies that includes the band you want to filter to. This determines which of the pre-designed Hilbert transformer filters is used internally (since if we tried to use one filter for all frequencies, it would end up with terrible performance everywhere). Note that the delta band is just too low to get a reasonably accurate phase estimate, even when downsampling to 500 Hz as this plugin does (before interpolating the output).

* Use "Low cut" and "High cut" to select the desired frequency passband. (Inputs should be unfiltered; the Phase Calculator uses its own bandpass filter internally.) Changing the frequency range will automatically set a default high and low cut, but they can be changed to filter to any band within the range.

* "AR Refresh" and "Order" control the autoregressive model used to predict the "future" portion of the Hilbert buffer. AR parameters are estimated using Burg's method. The default settings seem to work well, but other settings (particularly lower orders) may also work well.

* "Output" allows selection of which component(s) of the analytic signal to output (for all enabled channels). If PH+MAG is selected, a magnitude (amplitude envelope) output channel is added to the outputs for each selected input channel; they appear in the ascending numerical order of their corresponding input/phase output channels. See `PC_ph+mag_demo.png` for an example of outputtng both phase and magnitude.

### Event phase visualization

Clicking the tab or window button opens the "event phase plot" view. This allows non-real-time plotting of the precise phase of received TTL events on a channel of interest. The data channel must be one that is selected for processing in the Phase Calculator "params" drawer, as the filtering step is shared between real-time phase estimation and event phase visualization. All plot controls can be used while acquisition is running. "Phase reference" subtracts the input (in degrees) from all phases (in both the rose plot and the statistics).

I hope you find this to be useful!
